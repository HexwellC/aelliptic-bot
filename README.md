# AElliptic Bot

AElliptic Bot - Telegram bot developed specially for Ungovernable IRC server 
¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## Contribution

Sure, you can try to contribute it. Mostly you're probably interested in 
following files:

* src/commands.hpp (for commands registration)
* src/commands/ (directory for all commands)

Styling is simple: 80 symbols per line, camelCase prefered, license header 
required everywhere and, obviously, 4 spaces.
