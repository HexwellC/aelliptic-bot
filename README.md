# AElliptic Bot

AElliptic Bot - Telegram bot developed specially for [AEF 
group](https://t.me/aefoundation). The goal is to provide some new or already 
seen functionality but implemented in C++ in the sane way. Just for 
lulz ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## Contribution

Sure, you can try to contribute it. Mostly you're probably interested in 
following files:

* src/commands.hpp (for commands registration)
* src/commands/ (directory for all commands)

Styling is simple: 80 symbols per line, snake_case prefered, license 
header required everywhere and, obviously, 4 spaces.
